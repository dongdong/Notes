# Introduction to Descriptive Statistics @ Udacity

### 1. Intro to Research Methods

* Constructs
	- A construct is a variable that is not directly observable or measurable
	- E.g.: Intelligence (IQ test), Effort (minutes donging homework, grades, GPA), Age (age in years, wisdom), Hunger (how often tummy grumbles), Itchiness
	- Counterexample: Gallons of gasoline, Annual salary in USD


* Operational defination


* Lurking variables
	- Extraneous factors


* Sampling error

* Independent variable & Dependent variable


* Correlation & Causation
	- Correlation does **NOT** prove causation
	- Observational studies, Surveys => show relationships
	- Controlled experiment => show causation


### 2. Visualization Data

* Table:
	- Frequency, Relative frequence, Propotion, Percent


* Histogram
	- bin size


* Histogram & Bar graph
	- Histogram: x-axis: numberical/quantitative
	- Bar graph: x-axis: categorical/qualitiative 


* Biased graphs

### 3. Central Tendency

* Mode
* Median
* Mean


### 4. Variability

* Range
* IQR
* Outlier
* Boxplots
* Average deviation, Absolute deviation, squared deviation
* SS, Variance
* Standard Deviation
* Bessels correction


### 5. Standardizing

* Relative Frequency Distribution, Continuous Distribution
* Theoretical Normal Distribution
* Z-score

### 6. Normal Distribution

* PDF: Probability Distribution Function
* Z-table

### 7. Sampling Distribution

* Sample Means, Sampling Distribution
* Central Limit Theorem
* Standard Error, Mean of Sample Means
